In this exercise, you will learn about HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language) syntax.


Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.
#Outcomes

You should be able to:
- Launch terraform commands correctly
- Create terraform config files

#Steps

1. Creating Terraform configuration folder
  - Terraform configuration file have `.tf` extension. 
  - Terraform command needs to run in the directory of the config files. 
  - It can’t take files from subdirectories.

   ```
    mkdir ~/hcl-basics && cd ~/hcl-basics 
   ```
1. HCL is used for writing configuration files in Terraform. This is an example of a resource block in HCL.

   Create a file named `main.tf` with this content:
   ```
   resource "local_file" "games" {
      file  = "/tmp/favorite-games"
      content  = "FIFA 21"
    }
   ```
   - The Resource Type used in this file is `local_file`. The first value following the `resource` keyword in a resource block is the `resource type`. 
   - he name of the resource comes right after it's type. In our example, it's `games`.
   - The value before the underscore _ in the resource type is usually the provider.


4. Run Terraform plan

   The plan command gives us an idea about all the resource that are going to be provisoned using this terraform file. 
   ```
   terraform plan
   ```
   The command should fail since terraform didn't load the provider mentionned in this TF file. 

   For a newly created configuration, you must run the terraform init first.

   ```
   Error: Could not load plugin

   Plugin reinitialization required. Please run "terraform init".
   
   Plugins are external binaries that Terraform uses to access and manipulate
   resources. The configuration provided requires plugins which can't be located,
   don't satisfy the version constraints, or are otherwise incompatible.
   
   Terraform automatically discovers provider requirements from your
   configuration, including providers used in child modules. To see the
   requirements and constraints, run "terraform providers".
   
   Failed to instantiate provider "registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/local" to
   obtain schema: unknown provider "registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/local"
   ```
   Let's fix this error by running our next command:

5. Run Terraform init

   This command will mainly installed the providers or the backend for the terraform files.
   ```
   terraform init
   ```
   ```
   Initializing the backend...

   Initializing provider plugins...
   - Finding latest version of hashicorp/local...
   - Installing hashicorp/local v2.1.0...
   - Installed hashicorp/local v2.1.0 (self-signed, key ID 34365D9472D7468F)
   
   Partner and community providers are signed by their developers.
   If you'd like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here:
   https://www.terraform.io/docs/plugins/signing.html
   
   The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,
   so the latest version was installed.
   
   To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
   changes, we recommend adding version constraints in a required_providers block
   in your configuration, with the constraint strings suggested below.
   
   * hashicorp/local: version = "~> 2.1.0"
   
   Terraform has been successfully initialized!
   
   You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
   any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
   should now work.
   
   If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
   rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
   commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
   ```

6. Terraform Plan
   
   Now let's run our `plan` command again. 
   ```
   terraform plan
   ```
   It should fail with a different error.
   ```
   Error: Missing required argument

   on main.tf line 1, in resource "local_file" "games":
   1: resource "local_file" "games" {

   The argument "filename" is required, but no definition was found.

   Error: Unsupported argument

   on main.tf line 2, in resource "local_file" "games":
   2:   file     = "/tmp/favorite-games"

   An argument named "file" is not expected here.
   ```

   The command failed because there is no argument called file used in the local_file provider. In order to check all the arguments for this provider, check it's documentation at:
   ```
   https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/local/latest/docs/resources/file
   ```

7. Terraform plan
   
   Now let's fix the error and then run the previous command again 
   ```
   vi main.tf

   ```
   ```
   resource "local_file" "games" {
    filename  = "/tmp/favorite-games"
    content  = "FIFA 21"
   }
   ```
   ```
   terraform plan
   ```
   Output
   ```
   Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan.
   Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
     + create
   
   Terraform will perform the following actions:
   
     # local_file.games will be created
     + resource "local_file" "games" {
         + content              = "FIFA 21"
         + directory_permission = "0777"
         + file_permission      = "0777"
         + filename             = "/tmp/favorite-games"
         + id                   = (known after apply)
       }
   
   Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
   
   ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   
   Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee
   to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
   
   ```
8. Terraform apply
      
   Now, that our `plan` command succeeded, we can pass to terraform apply command in order to actually provision the resources.
   ```
   terraform apply
   ```  
   Type `yes` when asked to:
   ```
   Terraform will perform the following actions:

   # local_file.games will be created
   + resource "local_file" "games" {
       + content              = "FIFA 21"
       + directory_permission = "0777"
       + file_permission      = "0777"
       + filename             = "/tmp/favorite-games"
       + id                   = (known after apply)
     }
 
   Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
 
   Do you want to perform these actions?
   Terraform will perform the actions described above.
   Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.
 
   Enter a value: yes
 
   local_file.games: Creating...
   local_file.games: Creation complete after 0s [id=f68b901eb16aff12e9458bdb656a7df8d3425d4c]
   ```
   Let's now check that we successfully created this resource.
   ```
   cat /tmp/favorite-games
   ```
   ```
   FIFA 21
   ```
9. Dealing with sensitive data

    We have now created our very first resource using Terraform! Next, let's work on updating the resource.
      
    If you look at the output produced by the `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` commands closely, we can see that the file content is printed on the screen.

    Since we do not want this to happen, we have added another argument to the resource block.
    
   Let's edit our previous file to this:
   ```
   vi main.tf
   ```
   ```
   resource "local_file" "games" {
      filename     = "/tmp/favorite-games"
      content  = "FIFA 21"
      sensitive_content = "FIFA 21"
    }
   ```
   ```
   terraform plan    
   ```  
   - The argument content conflicts with sensitive_content. 
   - We will now delete the line containing the argument called content, run terraform, and then terraform apply to re-create the file.

   ```
   vi main.tf
   ```
   ```
   resource "local_file" "games" {
    filename     = "/tmp/favorite-games"
    sensitive_content = "FIFA 21"
   }
   ```
   ```
   terraform plan
   ```
   ```
   local_file.games: Refreshing state... [id=f68b901eb16aff12e9458bdb656a7df8d3425d4c]
   Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
   -/+ destroy and then create replacement
   Terraform will perform the following actions:  
     # local_file.games must be replaced
   -/+ resource "local_file" "games" {
         - content              = "FIFA 21" -> null # forces replacement
         ~ id                   = "f68b901eb16aff12e9458bdb656a7df8d3425d4c" -> (known after apply)
         + sensitive_content    = (sensitive value) # forces replacement
           # (3 unchanged attributes hidden)
       }
   Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy. 
   ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now. 
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
   can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
   "terraform apply" is subsequently run.
   ```
10. Reapply the config

   ```
   terraform apply
   ```
   ```
   local_file.games: Refreshing state... [id=f68b901eb16aff12e9458bdb656a7df8d3425d4c]

   An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
   Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
   -/+ destroy and then create replacement
   
   Terraform will perform the following actions:
   
     # local_file.games must be replaced
   -/+ resource "local_file" "games" {
         - content              = "FIFA 21" -> null # forces replacement
           directory_permission = "0777"
           file_permission      = "0777"
           filename             = "/tmp/favorite-games"
         ~ id                   = "f68b901eb16aff12e9458bdb656a7df8d3425d4c" -> (known after apply)
         + sensitive_content    = (sensitive value)
       }
   
   Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.
   
   Do you want to perform these actions?
     Terraform will perform the actions described above.
     Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.
   
     Enter a value: yes
   
   local_file.games: Destroying... [id=f68b901eb16aff12e9458bdb656a7df8d3425d4c]
   local_file.games: Destruction complete after 0s
   local_file.games: Creating...
   local_file.games: Creation complete after 0s [id=f68b901eb16aff12e9458bdb656a7df8d3425d4c]
   
   Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 1 destroyed.
   ```

   Notice that the content of the file was not displayed when using sensitive_content instead of the content argument.

   Note: This argument is specific to the local_file resource we are using. Refer to the documentation to see all the arguments supported by this resource:
   https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/local/latest/docs/resources/file#sensitive_content


   Also note that as Terraform follows an immutable infrastructure approach, the file was recreated although the contents are the same.

12. Cleaning Up

   Now, let's destroy the created resources since they are no longer needed.
   ```
   terraform destroy
   ```
   Type `yes` when asked to:
   ```
   local_file.games: Refreshing state... [id=f68b901eb16aff12e9458bdb656a7df8d3425d4c]

   An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
   Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
     - destroy
   
   Terraform will perform the following actions:
   
     # local_file.games will be destroyed
     - resource "local_file" "games" {
         - directory_permission = "0777" -> null
         - file_permission      = "0777" -> null
         - filename             = "/tmp/favorite-games" -> null
         - id                   = "f68b901eb16aff12e9458bdb656a7df8d3425d4c" -> null
         - sensitive_content    = (sensitive value)
       }
   
   Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.
   
   Do you really want to destroy all resources?
     Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
     There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.
   
     Enter a value: yes
   
   local_file.games: Destroying... [id=f68b901eb16aff12e9458bdb656a7df8d3425d4c]
   local_file.games: Destruction complete after 0s
   
   Destroy complete! Resources: 1 destroyed.
   ```
   Congrats! You've planned, created and destroyed your first terraform resource.
