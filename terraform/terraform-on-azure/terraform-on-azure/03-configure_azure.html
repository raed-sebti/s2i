In this exercise, you will Install the Azure CLI on our host machine.

#Outcomes

You should be able to:
- Configure Azure credentials on our host machine
- Test the configuration

#Installation Options

There are two options to install the Azure CLI on your system. 
- First, you may execute a single command that will download an install script and run the install commands for you. 
- Or if you prefer, you can execute the install commands yourself in a step-by-step process.

#Steps

1. Install with one command

  - The Azure CLI team maintains a script to run all installation commands in one step. 
  - This script is downloaded via curl and piped directly to bash to install the CLI.
  - If you wish to inspect the contents of the script yourself before executing, simply download the script first using curl and inspect it in your favorite text editor.

  ```
  curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
  ```

2. Sign in to Azure with the Azure CLI
- Run the Azure CLI with the az command. To sign in.
 - Use the az login command.
  ```
  az login
  ```
 - If the CLI can open your default browser, it will do so and load an Azure sign-in page.
 - Otherwise, open a browser page at https://aka.ms/devicelogin and enter the authorization code displayed in your terminal.
 - If no web browser is available or the web browser fails to open, use device code flow with az login --use-device-code.

3. Sign in with your account credentials in the browser.
 - To learn more about different authentication methods, see Sign in with Azure CLI.
 - Once logged in - it's possible to list the Subscriptions associated with the account via:
  ```
  az account list
  ```
 - The output (similar to below) will display one or more Subscriptions - with the id field being the subscription_id field.

  ```
  [
    {
      "cloudName": "AzureCloud",
      "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
      "isDefault": true,
      "name": "PAYG Subscription",
      "state": "Enabled",
      "tenantId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
      "user": {
        "name": "user@example.com",
        "type": "user"
      }
    }
  ]
  ```
- If you have more than one Subscription, you can specify the Subscription to use via the following command:
  ```
  az account set --subscription="SUBSCRIPTION_ID"  
  ```

1. Review terraform manifests
  ```
  mkdir ~/configure-azure && cd ~/configure-azure 
  ```
  ```
  vim main.tf
  ```
  ```
  # Terraform Settings Block
  terraform {
    required_version = ">= 1.0.0"
    required_providers {
      azurerm = {
        source = "hashicorp/azurerm"
        version = ">= 2.0" # Optional but recommended in production
      }    
    }
  }
  # Configure the Microsoft Azure Provider
  provider "azurerm" {
    features {}
  }
  # Create Resource Group 
  resource "azurerm_resource_group" "my_demo_rg1" {
    location = "eastus"
    name = "my-demo-rg1"  
  }
  ```
1. Terraform Core Commands
  - Run the following commands 

  ```
  # Terraform Initialize
  terraform init

  # Terraform Validate
  terraform validate

  # Terraform Plan to Verify what it is going to create / update / destroy
  terraform plan

  # Terraform Apply to Create Resources
  terraform apply 
  ```
1. Verify Azure Resource Group in Azure Management Console
  - Go to Azure Management Console -> Resource Groups
  - Verify newly created Resource Group
  - Review terraform.tfstate file

1. Destroy Infrastructure  
  ```
  # Destroy Azure Resource Group 
  terraform destroy
  ```
  Observation:
  1. Verify if the resource group got deleted in Azure Management Console
  2. Verify terraform.tfstate file and resource group info should be removed
  3. Verify terraform.tfstate.backup, it should have the resource group info here stored as backup. 
  
  ```
  # Delete Terraform files 
  rm -rf .terraform*
  rm -rf terraform.tfstate*
  ```
