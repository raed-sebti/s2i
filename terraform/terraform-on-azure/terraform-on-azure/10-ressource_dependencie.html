In this exercise, you will learn about resource attributes!

Terraform makes several kinds of named values available. Each of these names is an expression that references the associated value; 

You can use them as standalone expressions, or combine them with other expressions to compute new values.

#Outcomes

You should be able to:
- Understand Implicit/Explicit dependency
- Use dependencies

#Steps

1. Using implicit dependency 

  ```
  vi main.tf
  ```
  ```
  resource "time_static" "time_update" {
  }
  ```
  As you can see, the resource block is empty. This is because time_static does not need any arguments to be supplied to work.
  When applied as it is, terraform creates a logical resource locally with the current time.
  ```
  terraform init
  ```
  ```
  Initializing the backend...

  Initializing provider plugins...
  - Finding latest version of hashicorp/time...
  - Installing hashicorp/time v0.7.2...
  - Installed hashicorp/time v0.7.2 (signed by HashiCorp)
  
  Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
  selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
  so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
  you run "terraform init" in the future.
  
  Terraform has been successfully initialized!
  
  You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
  any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
  should now work.
  
  If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
  rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
  commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.  
  ```
  ```
  terraform plan
  ```
  ```
  Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource
  actions are indicated with the following symbols:
    + create
  
  Terraform will perform the following actions:
  
    # time_static.time_update will be created
    + resource "time_static" "time_update" {
        + day     = (known after apply)
        + hour    = (known after apply)
        + id      = (known after apply)
        + minute  = (known after apply)
        + month   = (known after apply)
        + rfc3339 = (known after apply)
        + second  = (known after apply)
        + unix    = (known after apply)
        + year    = (known after apply)
      }
  
  Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
  
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  
  Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take
  exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.  
  ```
  ```
  terraform apply 
  ```
  ``` 
  Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource
  actions are indicated with the following symbols:
    + create
  
  Terraform will perform the following actions:
  
    # time_static.time_update will be created
    + resource "time_static" "time_update" {
        + day     = (known after apply)
        + hour    = (known after apply)
        + id      = (known after apply)
        + minute  = (known after apply)
        + month   = (known after apply)
        + rfc3339 = (known after apply)
        + second  = (known after apply)
        + unix    = (known after apply)
        + year    = (known after apply)
      }
  
  Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
  
  Do you want to perform these actions?
    Terraform will perform the actions described above.
    Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.
  
    Enter a value: yes
  
  time_static.time_update: Creating...
  time_static.time_update: Creation complete after 0s [id=2021-07-18T19:13:10Z]  
  ```
  Check the attributes that are exported by the time_static resource
  
  Refer to the Argument Reference from the documentation: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/time/latest/docs/resources/static
  
  This is called implicit dependency. There is another way to declare a dependency between 2 resources:

2. Explicit Dependency

  In order to mention that a resource is depending on another, we can use the depends_on keyword.
  ```
  depends_on=[
  random_pet.my-pet
  ]
  ```
  Let's see a full scenario for this usecase!
  ```
  vi main.tf
  ```
  ```
  resource "tls_private_key" "pvtkey" {
    algorithm = "RSA"
    rsa_bits  = 4096
  }
  ```
  ```
  terraform init
  ```
  ```

  If you'd like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here:
  https://www.terraform.io/docs/plugins/signing.html
  
  The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,
  so the latest version was installed.
  
  To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
  changes, we recommend adding version constraints in a required_providers block
  in your configuration, with the constraint strings suggested below.
  
  * hashicorp/tls: version = "~> 3.1.0"

  As we can see in the log, even whale is declared first in the file test.tf, it was created after krill since it's depending on it.
