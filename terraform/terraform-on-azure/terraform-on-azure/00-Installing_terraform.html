In this exercise, you will set up your terraform environment.

Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. 

Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.
#Outcomes

You should be able to:
- Install terraform
- Run a smoke test

#Steps

1. Download Terraform:
   ```
   curl -O https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.0.2/terraform_1.0.2_linux_amd64.zip
   ```

2. Check where to unzip package:
   ```
   echo $PATH
   ```
   ```
   /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/tmp/bin
   ```
3. Unzip the ` terraform_1.0.2_linux_amd64.zip ` file under ` /usr/bin/ `:

   ```
   unzip  terraform_1.0.2_linux_amd64.zip -d /usr/bin/
   ```
4. Verify Installation:

   ```
   terraform -v
   ```
   ```
   Terraform v1.0.2
   ```
5. To add the necessary commands to your shell profile, run the following command:
   ```
   terraform -install-autocomplete
   ```
   After installation, it is necessary to restart your shell or to re-read its profile script before auto completion will be activated.
   ```
   exec bash
   ```

6. Creating Terraform configuration folder

   Terraform configuration file have `.tf` extension. 
   Terraform command needs to run in the directory of the config files. It canâ€™t take files from subdirectories.
   ```
   mkdir terraform-templates && cd terraform-templates
   ```
7. Create empty configuration file:
   ```
   touch main.tf
   ```
8. Run terraform apply:
   ```
   terraform apply
   ```
   ```
   Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
   ```
   Congratulations! You've set up your terraform environment.
