In this exercise, we will discuss the different methods of declaring variables.


#Outcomes

You should be able to:
- Declare env variable
- Use .auto.tfvars  
- Use .tfvars  
- Use command arguments

#Steps

In order to declare variables in a terraform file, we will go over each method individually

1. Environment variables
  
  We can declare our varialbs as env variables. The rule is to export variables using the prefix `TF_VAR_` followed by the variable name and a value.
  ```
  export TF_VAR_filename="/tmp/pets.txt"
  ```

2. Declare our variable in a file with the extention `.tfvars` 
  
  This type of files is not detected automatically by terraform, therefore we need to reference it when calling terraform commands
  ```
  vi cats.tfvars
  ```
  ```
  filename="/tmp/cats.txt"
  ```
  After declaring the variable and implementing it in a tf file, we should run the command in this way
  ```
  terraform plan -var-file=nam.tfvars
  ```

3. Declare our variable in a file with the extention `.auto.tfvars` 

  These files are automatically detected by terraform without the need for arguments to the terraform commands.
  variable.auto.tfvars
  ```
  content="Hey there!"
  ```
4. Pass in variables as an option to the terraform apply command ( or plan)
  ```
  terraform apply -var "filename=/tmp/cars.txt"
  ```

5. Precedence 

  If there is a duplicated variable declared in multiple places, terraform uses this scale in order to determine which variable to use.
  The scale of priority goes from 1 to 4, with 1 being the highest, 4 being the lowest priority. 
  
    ○ <b>1-</b> command line flag of -var or 
    
    ○ <b>2-</b> using .auto.tfvars
  
    ○ <b>3-</b> using terraform.tfvars
   
    ○ <b>4-</b> env variables

6. Example of using tf files

  Create a tf file with this configuration
  ```
  vi main.tf
  ```
  ```
  resource local_file games {
    filename = var.filename
    content = var.content
  } 
  ```
  We should now declare the variables used in the main.tf, which are `filename` and `content`
  ```
  vi variables.tf
  ```
  ```
  variable filename {
    type = string
  }
  variable content {
    type = string
  }
  ```
  Now, let's make use of one the methods to declare a variable, the `auto.tfvars` method!
  ```
  vi basket.auto.tfvars
  ```
  ```
  filename = "/tmp/basketball.txt"
  ```
  Then, let's plan this configuration
  ```
  terraform plan
  ```
  ```
  Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan.
  Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
    + create
  
  Terraform will perform the following actions:
  
    # local_file.jedi will be created
    + resource "local_file" "jedi" {
        + content              = "phanius"
        + directory_permission = "0777"
        + file_permission      = "0777"
        + filename             = "/tmp/first-jedi"
        + id                   = (known after apply)
      }
  
  Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
  
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  
  Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee
  to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
  ```
  Let's now apply this plan
  ```
  terraform apply
  ```
  ```
  Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan.
  Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
    + create
  
  Terraform will perform the following actions:
  
    # local_file.jedi will be created
    + resource "local_file" "jedi" {
        + content              = "phanius"
        + directory_permission = "0777"
        + file_permission      = "0777"
        + filename             = "/tmp/first-jedi"
        + id                   = (known after apply)
      }
  
  Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
  
  Do you want to perform these actions?
    Terraform will perform the actions described above.
    Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.
  
    Enter a value: yes
  
  local_file.jedi: Creating...
  local_file.jedi: Creation complete after 0s [id=23760ef64e0124aa08fecf101c302d3b64220d1a]
  
  Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.  
  ```
  Let's check the value of the created resource:
  ```
  cat /tmp/first-jedi
  ```
  Output
  ```
  phanius
  ```
  Bingo! We've succeded at declaring and using a variable instead of hard coding it into our code! 

8. Cleanup
  ```
  terraform destroy
  ```
  ```
  local_file.jedi: Refreshing state... [id=23760ef64e0124aa08fecf101c302d3b64220d1a]

  Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan.
  Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
    - destroy
  
  Terraform will perform the following actions:
  
    # local_file.jedi will be destroyed
    - resource "local_file" "jedi" {
        - content              = "phanius" -> null
        - directory_permission = "0777" -> null
        - file_permission      = "0777" -> null
        - filename             = "/tmp/first-jedi" -> null
        - id                   = "23760ef64e0124aa08fecf101c302d3b64220d1a" -> null
      }
  
  Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.
  
  Do you really want to destroy all resources?
    Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
    There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.
  
    Enter a value: yes
  
  local_file.jedi: Destroying... [id=23760ef64e0124aa08fecf101c302d3b64220d1a]
  local_file.jedi: Destruction complete after 0s
  
  Destroy complete! Resources: 1 destroyed.
