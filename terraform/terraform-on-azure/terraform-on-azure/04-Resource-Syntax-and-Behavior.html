In this exercise, you will unserstand Resource Syntax and Behavior.

#Outcomes

You should be able to:
- We are going to understand about below concepts from Resource Syntax perspective
- Resource Block
- Resource Type
- Resource Local Name
- Resource Arguments
- Resource Meta-Arguments

#Steps

1. Creating Terraform configuration folder
  - Terraform configuration file have `.tf` extension. 
  - Terraform command needs to run in the directory of the config files. 
  - It canâ€™t take files from subdirectories.

  ```
  mkdir ~/resource-syntax-and-behavior && cd ~/resource-syntax-and-behavior 
  ```
  ```
  vim c1-versions.tf
  ```
  ```
  # Terraform Block
  terraform {
    required_version = ">= 1.0.0"
    required_providers {
      azurerm = {
        source = "hashicorp/azurerm"
        version = ">= 2.0" 
      }
    }
  }
  
  # Provider Block
  provider "azurerm" {
   features {}          
  }
  ```
  ```
  vim c2-resource-group.tf
  ```
  ```
  # Resource-1: Azure Resource Group
  resource "azurerm_resource_group" "myrg" {
    name = "myrg-1"
    location = "East US"
  }
  ```  


1. Add more resources 
 - Resource-2: Create Virtual Network
 - Resource-3: Create Subnet
 - Resource-4: Create Public IP Address
 - Resource-5: Create Network Interface

  ```
  vim c3-virtual-network.tf
  ```
  ```    
  # Resource-2: Create Virtual Network
  resource "azurerm_virtual_network" "myvnet" {
    name                = "myvnet-1"
    address_space       = ["10.0.0.0/16"]
    location            = azurerm_resource_group.myrg.location
    resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.myrg.name
  }
  
  # Resource-3: Create Subnet
  resource "azurerm_subnet" "mysubnet" {
    name                 = "mysubnet-1"
    resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.myrg.name
    virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.myvnet.name
    address_prefixes     = ["10.0.2.0/24"]
  }
  
  # Resource-4: Create Public IP Address
  resource "azurerm_public_ip" "mypublicip" {
    name                = "mypublicip-1"
    resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.myrg.name
    location            = azurerm_resource_group.myrg.location
    allocation_method   = "Static"
    tags = {
      environment = "Dev"
    }
  }
  
  # Resource-5: Create Network Interface
  resource "azurerm_network_interface" "myvm1nic" {
    name                = "vm1-nic"
    location            = azurerm_resource_group.myrg.location
    resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.myrg.name
  
    ip_configuration {
      name                          = "internal"
      subnet_id                     = azurerm_subnet.mysubnet.id
      private_ip_address_allocation = "Dynamic"
      public_ip_address_id = azurerm_public_ip.mypublicip.id 
    }
  }
  ```
1. Understand Resource Behavior
  We are going to understand resource behavior in combination with Terraform State
  - Create Resource
  - Update in-place Resources
  - Destroy and Re-create Resources
  - Destroy Resource

1. Resource: Create Resources

  ```
  # Initialize Terraform
  terraform init

  Observation: 
  1) Successfully downloaded providers in .terraform folder
  2) Created lock file named ".terraform.lock.hcl"

  # Validate Terraform configuration files
  terraform validate
  Observation: No files changed / added in current working directory

  # Format Terraform configuration files
  terraform fmt
  Observations: *.tf files will change to format them if any format changes exists

  # Review the terraform plan
  terraform plan 
  Observation-1: Nothing happens during the first run from terraform state perspective
  Observation-2: From Resource Behavior perspective you can see "+ create", we are creating 

  # Create Resources 
  terraform apply -auto-approve
  Observation: 
  1) Creates terraform.tfstate file in local working directory
  2) Creates actual resource in Azure Cloud
  ```
1. Understanding Terraform State File
  - What is Terraform State ?
    - It is the primary core thing for terraform to function
    - In a short way, its the underlying database containing the resources information which are provisioning using Terraform
    - Primary Purpose: To store bindings between objects in a remote system and resource instances declared in your configuration.
    - When Terraform creates a remote object in response to a change of configuration, it will record the identity of that remote object against a particular resource instance, and then potentially update or delete that object in response to future configuration changes.
    - Terraform state file created when we first run the terraform apply
    - Terraform state file is created locally in working directory.
    - If required, we can confiure the backend block in terraform block which will allow us to store state file remotely. Storing remotely is recommended option which we will see in the next section of the course.  
1. Review terraform.tfstate file
  - Terraform State files are JSON based
  - Manual editing of Terraform state files is highly not recommended
  - Review terraform.tfstate file step by step  
  ```
  terraform show
  ``` 
1. Resource: Update In-Place: Make changes by adding new tag to Virtual Network Resource
  - Add a new tag in azurerm_virtual_network resource
  - Add this for Virtual Network Resource
    "Environment" = "Dev"
  - Review Terraform Plan
  ``` 
  - Review the terraform plan
  ``` 
  terraform plan 
  Observation: You should see "~ update in-place" 
  "Plan: 0 to add, 1 to change, 0 to destroy."
  ``` 
  - Create / Update Resources 
  ``` 
  terraform apply -auto-approve
  Observation: "Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 1 changed, 0 destroyed."
  ``` 
  - Important Note: Here we have seen example for update in-place
  
1. Resource: Destroy and Re-create Resources: Update Virtual Network Name
  - This will destroy the Virtual Network, Subnet and Recreate them.
  ``` 
  /* Before
  name                = "vm1-nic"
  /* After
  name                = "vm1-nic1"
  ``` 
  - Execute Terraform Commands
  ``` 
    #Review the terraform plan
    terraform plan 
    Observation: 
    1)   -/+ destroy and then create replacement
    2) -/+ resource "azurerm_network_interface" "myvm1nic" {
    3) -/+ resource "azurerm_network_interface" "myvm1nic" {
    4) Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 2 to destroy.
    
    # Create / Update Resources 
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    Observation: 
    1. Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 2 destroyed. 
    ``` 

1. Resource: Destroy Resource
    ``` 
    # Destroy Resource
    terraform destroy 

    Observation: 
    1) - destroy
    2) All 7 resources will be destroyed
    3) Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 7 to destroy.
    4) Destroy complete! Resources: 7 destroyed.
    ``` 
# Clean-Up
    ``` 
    # Destroy Resource
    terraform destroy -auto-approve 

    # Remove Terraform Files
    rm -rf .terraform*
    rm -rf terraform.tfstate* 
    ```
