In this exercise, you will practice outputting variables.

Resource instances managed by Terraform each export attributes whose values can be used elsewhere in configuration. Output values are a way to expose some of that information to the user of your module.


Output values are like the return values of a Terraform module, and have several uses:

  - A child module can use outputs to expose a subset of its resource attributes to a parent module.
  - A root module can use outputs to print certain values in the CLI output after running terraform apply.
  - When using remote state, root module outputs can be accessed by other configurations via a terraform_remote_state data source.

#Outcomes

You should be able to:
- Output variables

#Steps

1. In this lab, we will make use of a provider called `random`. It will generates for us some random ids, so we can use output variables later on to display them on the console!

  ```
  vi main.tf
  ```
  ```
  resource "random_uuid" "id1" {
   
  }
  resource "random_uuid" "id2" {
     
  }
  resource "random_uuid" "id3" {
     
  }
  resource "random_uuid" "id4" {
     
  }
  resource "random_uuid" "id5" {
     
  }
  resource "random_uuid" "id6" {
     
  }
  resource "random_uuid" "id7" {
     
  }
  resource "random_integer" "order1" {
    min     = 1
    max     = 99999
   
  }
  resource "random_integer" "order2" {
    min     = 1
    max     = 222222
   
  }
  ```
  Let's now declare all the variables that we want to output values for! It can be done this way:
  ```
  vi output.tf
  ```
  ```
  output "id1" {
    value = random_uuid.id1.result
  }
  output "id2" {
     value = random_uuid.id2.result
    
  }
  output "id3" {
     value = random_uuid.id3.result 
  }
  output "id4" {
     value = random_uuid.id4.result
    
  }
  output "id5" {
     value = random_uuid.id5.result
  }
    
  output "id6" {
     value = random_uuid.id6.result
    
  }
  output "id7" {
     value = random_uuid.id7.result   
  }
  output "order1" {
  value = random_integer.order1.result
  
  }
  output "order2" {
  value = random_integer.order1.result
  }
  ```
  Then, let's initialize our project!
  ```
  terraform init 
  ```
  ```
  Initializing provider plugins...
  - Finding latest version of hashicorp/random...
  - Installing hashicorp/random v3.1.0...
  - Installed hashicorp/random v3.1.0 (self-signed, key ID 34365D9472D7468F)
  
  Partner and community providers are signed by their developers.
  If you'd like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here:
  https://www.terraform.io/docs/plugins/signing.html
  
  The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,
  so the latest version was installed.
  
  To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
  changes, we recommend adding version constraints in a required_providers block
  in your configuration, with the constraint strings suggested below.
  
  * hashicorp/random: version = "~> 3.1.0"
  
  Terraform has been successfully initialized!
  
  You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
  any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
  should now work.
  
  If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
  rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
  commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
  ```
  ```
  terraform plan
  ```
  ```
  Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
  The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
  persisted to local or remote state storage.
  
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
  Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
    + create
  
  Terraform will perform the following actions:
  
    # random_integer.order1 will be created
    + resource "random_integer" "order1" {
        + id     = (known after apply)
        + max    = 99999

      }
  
    # random_integer.order2 will be created
    + resource "random_integer" "order2" {
        + id     = (known after apply)
        + max    = 222222

      }
  
  Plan: 9 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
  
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
  can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
  "terraform apply" is subsequently run.
  ```
  ```
  terraform apply
  ```
  As we can see, the results are printed out as an `Outputs` section in the end of the terraform apply command:

  ```
5. Cleanup

  Let's now cleanup all the resources that we've created!
  ```
  terraform destroy
  ```
6. Terraform on Azure 
  - Creating Terraform configuration folder
  - Terraform configuration file have `.tf` extension. 
  - Terraform command needs to run in the directory of the config files. 
  - It can’t take files from subdirectories.

  ```
  mkdir ~/output-project  && cd ~/output-project 
  ```  
1. c1-versions.tf
  ``` 
  # Terraform Block
  terraform {
    required_version = ">= 1.0.0"
    required_providers {
      azurerm = {
        source = "hashicorp/azurerm"
        version = ">= 2.0" 
      }
    }
  }

  # Provider Block
  provider "azurerm" {

  ``` 
1. c2-variables.tf
  ``` 
  # Input Variables

  # 1. Business Unit Name
  variable "business_unit" {
    description = "Business Unit Name"
    type = string
    default = "hr"
  }
  # 2. Environment Name
  variable "environment" {
    description = "Environment Name"
    type = string
    default = "poc"
  }
  # 3. Resource Group Name
  variable "resoure_group_name" {
    description = "Resource Group Name"
    type = string
    default = "myrg"
  }
  # 4. Resource Group Location
  variable "resoure_group_location" {
    description = "Resource Group Location"
    type = string
    default = "East US"
  }

  # 5. Virtual Network Name
  variable "virtual_network_name" {
    description = "Virtual Network Name"
    type = string 
    default = "myvnet"
  }  
  ``` 
1. c3-resource-group.tf
  ``` 
  # Resource-1: Azure Resource Group
  resource "azurerm_resource_group" "myrg" {

    location = var.resoure_group_location
  }  
  ```

    location            = azurerm_resource_group.myrg.location
    resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.myrg.name
  }  
  ``` 
1. terraform.tfvars
  ```
  business_unit = "it"
  environment = "dev"
  resoure_group_name = "rg"
  virtual_network_name = "vnet"  
  ```
1. c5-outputs.tf
  ```
  # 1. Output Values - Resource Group
  output "resource_group_id" {
    description = "Resource Group ID"
    # Atrribute Reference
    value = azurerm_resource_group.myrg.id 
  }
  output "resource_group_name" {
    description = "Resource Group name"
    # Argument Reference
    value = azurerm_resource_group.myrg.name  
  }

  # 2. Output Values - Virtual Network
  output "virtual_network_name" {
    description = "Virutal Network Name"
    value = azurerm_virtual_network.myvnet.name 
  }  
  ```
1. Execute Terraform Commands
  ```
  # Initialize Terraform
  terraform init

  # Validate Terraform configuration files
  terraform validate

  # Format Terraform configuration files
  terraform fmt

  # Review the terraform plan
  terraform plan 

  # Create Resources
  terraform apply -auto-approve

  # Observation
  1. Review the outputs in CLI Output
  ```
1. Query Terraform Outputs
  - Terraform will load the project state in state file, so that using terraform output command we can query the state file.
  ``` 
  # Terraform Output Commands
  terraform output
  terraform output resource_group_id
  terraform output virtual_network_name  
  ```
1. Output Values - Suppressing Sensitive Values in Output
- We can redact the sensitive outputs using sensitve = true in output block
- This will only redact the cli output for terraform plan and apply
- When you query using terraform output, you will be able to fetch exact values from terraform.tfstate files
- Add sensitve = true for output virtual_network_name
  ```
  # 2. Output Values - Virtual Network
  output "virtual_network_name" {
    description = "Virutal Network Name"
    value = azurerm_virtual_network.myvnet.name 
    sensitive = true
  }
  ```
- Test the flow
  ```
  # Terraform Apply
  terraform apply -auto-approve
  Observation: 
  1. You should see the value as sensitive

  # Query using terraform output
  terraform output virtual_network_name
  Observation: 
  1. You should get non-redacted original value from terraform.tfstate file  
  ```
1. Generate machine-readable output
  ```
  # Generate machine-readable output
  terraform output -json  
  ```
1. Destroy Resources
  ```
  # Destroy Resources
  terraform destroy -auto-approve

  # Clean-Up
  rm -rf .terraform*
  rm -rf terraform.tfstate*

  # Comment sensitive=true
  In c5-outputs.tf, roll back "sensitive=true"  
  ```
