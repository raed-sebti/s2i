In this exercise, you will learn how to use count and foreach in terraform config files.

By default, a resource block configures one real infrastructure object. However, sometimes you want to manage several similar objects (like a fixed pool of compute instances) 

without writing a separate block for each one. Terraform has two ways to do this: count and for_each.



#Outcomes

You should be able to:
- Use count meta-argument
- Use foreach meta-argument

#Steps

1. Hard coded value 

  ```
  vi main.tf
  ```
  ```
  resource "local_file" "pet" {
    filename = var.filename[count.index]
    count= 3
  }
  ```
  ```
  vi variables.tf
  ```
  ```
  variable "filename" {
    default =[
    "/tmp/pet1.txt",
    "/tmp/pet2.txt",
    "/tmp/pet3.txt"
    ]
  }
  ```
  ```
  terraform init
  ```
  ```
  Initializing the backend...

  Initializing provider plugins...
  - Finding latest version of hashicorp/local...
  - Installing hashicorp/local v2.1.0...
  - Installed hashicorp/local v2.1.0 (signed by HashiCorp)
  
  Terraform has created a lock file .terraform.lock.hcl to record the provider
  selections it made above. Include this file in your version control repository
  so that Terraform can guarantee to make the same selections by default when
  you run "terraform init" in the future.
  
  Terraform has been successfully initialized!
  
  You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
  any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
  should now work.
  
  If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
  rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
  commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.  
  ```
  ```
  terraform plan
  ```
  As we can see in the output, terraform will create 3 files for us using the list provided in the variables section.
  ```
    Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # local_file.pet[0] will be created
  + resource "local_file" "pet" {
      + directory_permission = "0777"
      + file_permission      = "0777"
      + filename             = "/tmp/pet1.txt"
      + id                   = (known after apply)
    }

  # local_file.pet[1] will be created
  + resource "local_file" "pet" {
      + directory_permission = "0777"
      + file_permission      = "0777"
      + filename             = "/tmp/pet2.txt"
      + id                   = (known after apply)
    }

  # local_file.pet[2] will be created
  + resource "local_file" "pet" {
      + directory_permission = "0777"
      + file_permission      = "0777"
      + filename             = "/tmp/pet3.txt"
      + id                   = (known after apply)
    }

  Plan: 3 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
  ```
  ```
  terraform apply 
  ```
  ```
    Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # local_file.pet[0] will be created
  + resource "local_file" "pet" {
      + directory_permission = "0777"
      + file_permission      = "0777"
      + filename             = "/tmp/pet1.txt"
      + id                   = (known after apply)
    }

  # local_file.pet[1] will be created
  + resource "local_file" "pet" {
      + directory_permission = "0777"
      + file_permission      = "0777"
      + filename             = "/tmp/pet2.txt"
      + id                   = (known after apply)
    }

  # local_file.pet[2] will be created
  + resource "local_file" "pet" {
      + directory_permission = "0777"
      + file_permission      = "0777"
      + filename             = "/tmp/pet3.txt"
      + id                   = (known after apply)
    }

  Plan: 3 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

  Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

  local_file.pet[1]: Creating...
  local_file.pet[0]: Creating...
  local_file.pet[2]: Creating...
  local_file.pet[0]: Creation complete after 0s [id=da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709]
  local_file.pet[1]: Creation complete after 0s [id=da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709]
  local_file.pet[2]: Creation complete after 0s [id=da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709]

  Apply complete! Resources: 3 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
  ```
2. Generic values
    
  One drawback of the previous method is that if we add more values in the variables, they will not be created as we fixed the count to 3.

  A better way of doing this is using the length method:
  ```
  vi main.tf
  ```
  ```
  resource "local_file" "pet" {
    filename = var.filename[count.index]
    count= length(var.filename)
  }
  ```
  ```
  vi variables.tf
  ```
  ```
  variable "filename" {
    default =[
    "/tmp/pet1.txt",
    "/tmp/pet2.txt",
    "/tmp/pet3.txt",
    "/tmp/pet4.txt"
    ]
  }
  ```
  ```
  terraform apply
  ```
  ```
  Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # local_file.pet[0] will be created
  + resource "local_file" "pet" {
      + directory_permission = "0777"
      + file_permission      = "0777"
      + filename             = "/tmp/pet1.txt"
      + id                   = (known after apply)
    }

  # local_file.pet[1] will be created
  + resource "local_file" "pet" {
      + directory_permission = "0777"
      + file_permission      = "0777"
      + filename             = "/tmp/pet2.txt"
      + id                   = (known after apply)
    }

  # local_file.pet[2] will be created
  + resource "local_file" "pet" {
      + directory_permission = "0777"
      + file_permission      = "0777"
      + filename             = "/tmp/pet3.txt"
      + id                   = (known after apply)
    }

  # local_file.pet[3] will be created
  + resource "local_file" "pet" {
      + directory_permission = "0777"
      + file_permission      = "0777"
      + filename             = "/tmp/pet4.txt"
      + id                   = (known after apply)
    }

  Plan: 3 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

  Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

  local_file.pet[1]: Creating...
  local_file.pet[0]: Creating...
  local_file.pet[2]: Creating...
  local_file.pet[3]: Creating...
  local_file.pet[0]: Creation complete after 0s [id=da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709]
  local_file.pet[1]: Creation complete after 0s [id=da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709]
  local_file.pet[2]: Creation complete after 0s [id=da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709]
  local_file.pet[3]: Creation complete after 0s [id=da39a3ee5e6b4b0d3255bfef95601890afd80709]

  Apply complete! Resources: 3 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
  ```
  As we can see, we can create as many files as we want now, just by adding the filenames to the variables file!

# Terraform on Azure

1. Simple Example 
  ```
  mkdir ~/count-project && cd ~/count-project
  ```
  ```
  vim c1-versions.tf
  ```
  ```
  # Terraform Block
  terraform {
    required_version = ">= 1.0.0"
    required_providers {
      azurerm = {
        source = "hashicorp/azurerm"
        version = ">= 2.0" 
      }
    }
  }

  # Provider Block
  provider "azurerm" {
  features {}          
  }
  ```
  ```
  vim   c2-resource-group.tf
  ```
  ```
  # Resource-1: Azure Resource Group
  resource "azurerm_resource_group" "myrg" {
    name = "myrg-${count.index}"
    location = "East US"
    count = 3
  }
  ```  
1.Execute Terraform Commands

  ```
  # Terraform Initialize
  terraform init

  # Terraform Validate
  terraform validate

  # Terraform Plan 
  terraform plan

  # Terraform Apply 
  terraform apply 

  # Terraform Destroy
  terraform destroy -auto-approve

  # Verify
  1. We should see 3 Resource groups created.
  2. Verify the count.index number for each resource group
