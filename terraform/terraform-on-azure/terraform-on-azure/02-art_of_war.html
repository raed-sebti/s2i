In this exercise, you will learn more about the terraform lifecycle and the local provider.

#Outcomes
You should be able to
- Write Terraform configuration files 
- Initialize Terraform with terraform init
- Deploy a local file using a local provider
- Cleaning-up with terraform destroy
    
  
#Steps

<h4>Writing the Terraform Configuration Files</h4>

1. Create a art_of_war directory

  Let’s get started by creating a new workspace for Terraform. This can be any folder on your computer, as long as it doesn’t contain Terraform configuration files:

  ```
  mkdir art_of_war && cd art_of_war
  ```

2. In this folder, make a new file called `main.tf` and insert the following code:
  ```
  vi main.tf
  ```
  ```
  terraform {
        required_version = "~> 1.0.0"
        required_providers {
            local = "~> 1.2"
          }
  }
  resource "local_file" "literature" {
        content  = <<-EOT
            Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.
            It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to
            ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be
            neglected.
          EOT
        filename = "art_of_war.txt"
  }
  ```

<h4>Initializing the Workspace</h4>

1. Initialize Terraform
  
  At this point, Terraform isn’t aware of your workspace,because it hasn’t been initialized yet. 

  Let’s fix that by running a ` terraform init ` The command and output are shown below:
  ```
  terraform init
  ```
  ```
  Initializing the backend...

  Initializing provider plugins...
  - Finding hashicorp/local versions matching "~> 1.2"...
  - Installing hashicorp/local v1.4.0...
  - Installed hashicorp/local v1.4.0 (signed by HashiCorp)
  
  Terraform has been successfully initialized!
  
  You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
  any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
  should now work.
  
  If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
  rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
  commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
  ```

2. You can view the files that were created as a result of ` terraform init ` with Tree:

  ```
  tree -a
  ```
  ```
  |-- main.tf
  `-- .terraform
      `-- plugins
          |-- registry.terraform.io
          |   `-- hashicorp
          |       `-- local
          |           `-- 1.4.0
          |               `-- linux_amd64
          |                   `-- terraform-provider-local_v1.4.0_x4
          `-- selections.json
  
  7 directories, 3 files
  ```

<h4> Generating an Execution Plan</h4>

1. Terraform planning

  Before we create the resource with a terraform apply, we can preview what Terraform intends to do by having it output the result of an execution plan. 
  
  Do this by running the command ` terraform plan `  in the terminal. The command and output are shown below.
  ```
  terraform plan
  ```
  ```
  Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
  The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
  persisted to local or remote state storage.
  
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
  Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
    + create
  
  Terraform will perform the following actions:
  
    # local_file.literature will be created
    + resource "local_file" "literature" {
        + content              = <<~EOT
              Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.
              It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to
              ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be
              neglected.
          EOT
        + directory_permission = "0777"
        + file_permission      = "0777"
        + filename             = "art_of_war.txt"
        + id                   = (known after apply)
      }
  
  Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
  
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
  can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
  "terraform apply" is subsequently run.  
  ```
 
<h4> Creating the Local File Resource</h4>

1. Applying changes

  Next let’s run a ` terraform apply ` and see how the output compares to the execution plan we created from terraform plan. 
  
  The command and output are shown below.
  ```
  terraform apply
  ```
  ```
  An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
  Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
    + create
  
  Terraform will perform the following actions:
  
    # local_file.literature will be created
    + resource "local_file" "literature" {
        + content              = <<~EOT
              Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.
              It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to
              ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be
              neglected.
          EOT
        + directory_permission = "0777"
        + file_permission      = "0777"
        + filename             = "art_of_war.txt"
        + id                   = (known after apply)
      }
  
  Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
  
  Do you want to perform these actions?
    Terraform will perform the actions described above.
    Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.
  
    Enter a value: yes
  
  local_file.literature: Creating...
  local_file.literature: Creation complete after 0s [id=262612c6b5e2169d098751e409cfbd26d6715ba2]
  
  Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
  ```

2. Check changes

  Two files were created as a result of this command, art_of_war.txt, and terraform.tfstate file. 
  
  You can view these files in the working directory by using the following command.
  ```
  tree -a
  ```
  ```
  |-- art_of_war.txt
  |-- main.tf
  |-- .terraform
  |   `-- plugins
  |       |-- registry.terraform.io
  |       |   `-- hashicorp
  |       |       `-- local
  |       |           `-- 1.4.0
  |       |               `-- linux_amd64
  |       |                   `-- terraform-provider-local_v1.4.0_x4
  |       `-- selections.json
  `-- terraform.tfstate
  
  7 directories, 5 files
  ```

3. Check art_of_war file 

  We can verify that the art_of_war.txt matches what we expect. This can easily be done by cat-ing the file in the cli. 

  The command and output are shown below. 
  ```
  cat art_of_war.txt
  ```
  ```
  Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.
  It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to
  ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be
  neglected.
  ```
 
<h4> Updating the Local File Resource</h4>
 
1. Now we are going to update our file content by adding some lines to it:
  
  ```
  vi main.tf
  ```
  ```
  terraform {
          required_version = "~> 1.0.0"
          required_providers {
            local = "~> 1.2"
          }
  }
  resource "local_file" "literature" {
          content  = <<-EOT
            Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.
            It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to
            ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be
            neglected.

            The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be 
            taken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to 
            determine the conditions obtaining in the field. 
            These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The 
            Commander; (5) Method and discipline. 
            EOT
          filename = "art_of_war.txt"
  }
  ```

2. Update Changes

  There isn’t a special command for running a Terraform update. All we need to do is run a ` terraform apply `  to execute the changes. 
  
  Before we do that, let’s first perform a ` terraform plan ` to see what the generated execution plan looks like. 
  
  The command and output are shown below.
  ```
  terraform plan
  ```
  ```
  Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
  The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
  persisted to local or remote state storage.
  
  local_file.literature: Refreshing state... [id=262612c6b5e2169d098751e409cfbd26d6715ba2]
  
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
  Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  -/+ destroy and then create replacement
  
  Terraform will perform the following actions:
  
    # local_file.literature must be replaced
  -/+ resource "local_file" "literature" {
        ~ content              = <<~EOT # forces replacement
              Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.
              It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to
              ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be
              neglected.
            + 
            + The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be 
            + taken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to 
            + determine the conditions obtaining in the field. 
            + These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The 
            + Commander; (5) Method and discipline. 
          EOT
          directory_permission = "0777"
          file_permission      = "0777"
          filename             = "art_of_war.txt"
        ~ id                   = "262612c6b5e2169d098751e409cfbd26d6715ba2" -> (known after apply)
      }
  
  Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 1 to destroy.
  
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
  can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
  "terraform apply" is subsequently run.
  ```

4. Apply changes 
  
  Go ahead and apply the proposed changes from the execution plan by running the command ` terraform apply -auto-approve ` . The command and output are shown below.
  ```
  terraform apply -auto-approve
  ```
  ```
  local_file.literature: Refreshing state... [id=262612c6b5e2169d098751e409cfbd26d6715ba2]
  local_file.literature: Destroying... [id=262612c6b5e2169d098751e409cfbd26d6715ba2]
  local_file.literature: Destruction complete after 0s
  local_file.literature: Creating...
  local_file.literature: Creation complete after 0s [id=9ae8fecfcb936dce0e646bcf75cc9d8adecff05d]
  
  Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 1 destroyed.
  ```
 
3. Check our art_of_war file

  We can verify that the art_of_war.txt matches what we expect. This can easily be done by cat-ing the file in the cli. 
  
  The command and output are shown below. 
  ```
  cat art_of_war.txt
  ```
  ```
  Sun Tzu said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.
  It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to
  ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be
  neglected.
  
  The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be 
  taken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to 
  determine the conditions obtaining in the field. 
  These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The 
  Commander; (5) Method and discipline. 
  ```

<h4> Deleting the Local File Resource</h4>
 
1. Destroying our resources

  Our “Art of War” file had a good run. Let’s go ahead and clean it up using the terraform destroy command. 
  
  Type the following command into the cli (output is shown below):
  ```
  terraform destroy -auto-approve
  ```
  ```
  local_file.literature: Refreshing state... [id=9ae8fecfcb936dce0e646bcf75cc9d8adecff05d]
  local_file.literature: Destroying... [id=9ae8fecfcb936dce0e646bcf75cc9d8adecff05d]
  local_file.literature: Destruction complete after 0s
  
  Destroy complete! Resources: 1 destroyed.
  ```

2. You can verify the art_of_war.txt file was deleted by listing the files in the directory:

  ```
  tree -a
  ```
  ```
  |-- art.tf
  |-- .terraform
  |   `-- plugins
  |       |-- registry.terraform.io
  |       |   `-- hashicorp
  |       |       `-- local
  |       |           `-- 1.4.0
  |       |               `-- linux_amd64
  |       |                   `-- terraform-provider-local_v1.4.0_x4
  |       `-- selections.json
  |-- terraform.tfstate
  `-- terraform.tfstate.backup
  
  7 directories, 5 files
  ```
