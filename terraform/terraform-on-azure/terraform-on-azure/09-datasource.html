In this exercise, you will learn about datasources

Data sources allow Terraform use information defined outside of Terraform, defined by another separate Terraform configuration, or modified by functions.


#Outcomes

You should be able to:
- Use data sources

#Steps

1. In this example, we will use information provided by Linux in order to use them in our configuration. 

  In our case, we will just load the information from a `datasource`, which is a local_file, but it could be loaded from any provider outhere! 
  
  Then, we will output to the terminal. In order to achieve this we will make us of the data sources as mentioned in this file:
  ```
  vi main.tf
  ```
  ```
  output "os-version" {
    value = data.local_file.os.content
  }
  data "local_file" "os" {
    filename = "/etc/os-release"
  }
  ```
  Now, let's initialize our project.
  ```
  terraform init
  ```
  ```
  Initializing the backend...

  Initializing provider plugins...
  - Finding latest version of hashicorp/local...
  - Installing hashicorp/local v2.1.0...
  - Installed hashicorp/local v2.1.0 (self-signed, key ID 34365D9472D7468F)
  
  Partner and community providers are signed by their developers.
  If you'd like to know more about provider signing, you can read about it here:
  https://www.terraform.io/docs/plugins/signing.html
  
  The following providers do not have any version constraints in configuration,
  so the latest version was installed.
  
  To prevent automatic upgrades to new major versions that may contain breaking
  changes, we recommend adding version constraints in a required_providers block
  in your configuration, with the constraint strings suggested below.
  
  * hashicorp/local: version = "~> 2.1.0"
  
  Terraform has been successfully initialized!
  
  You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
  any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
  should now work.
  
  If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
  rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
  commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
  ```
  ```
  terraform plan
  ```
  ``` 
  Refreshing Terraform state in-memory prior to plan...
  The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
  persisted to local or remote state storage.
  
  data.local_file.os: Refreshing state...
  
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
  Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  
  Terraform will perform the following actions:
  
  Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
  
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
  can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
  "terraform apply" is subsequently run.
  ```
  ```
  terraform apply
  ```
  ```
  data.local_file.os: Refreshing state...

  An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
  Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  
  Terraform will perform the following actions:
  
  Plan: 0 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
  
  Do you want to perform these actions?
    Terraform will perform the actions described above.
    Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.
  
    Enter a value: yes
  
  Apply complete! Resources: 0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
  
  Outputs:
  
  os-version = PRETTY_NAME="Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch)"
  NAME="Debian GNU/Linux"
  VERSION_ID="9"
  VERSION="9 (stretch)"
  VERSION_CODENAME=stretch
  ID=debian
  HOME_URL="https://www.debian.org/"
  SUPPORT_URL="https://www.debian.org/support"
  BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugs.debian.org/"
  ```
  Bingo! As we can see, we've loaded a bunch of information about the host machine using datasource, we could use this information for 

  doing some configuration tasks as well!
  
5. Cleanup

  Let's now cleanup all the resources that we've created!
  ```
  terraform destroy
  ```
